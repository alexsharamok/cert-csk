              Water is essential for all life on earth, however we rely on a
              balance of water to sustain life. Too little and we dry up, too
              much and we flood.

              Now, I know what you are asking, what does WATER have to do with
              my COFFEE?

              Like all fine things in life, complex flavors rely on balance to
              really bring to life all the amazing tastes and sensations. The
              same applies to coffee, with its inability to cope with unbalanced
              or over balanced dosing.

              I tend to refer to coffee as being allergic to the 21st century,
              and if you thought hipsters were fussy about their coffee, youâ€™ll
              be surprised to know that their coffee is WAY more fussy than they
              are! Here is a sneaky tip to help get the most out of your
              espresso shot!

              Lets focus on RATIOs. Specifically the WATER:COFFEE ratio in both
              your BASKET and your CUP!

              The Golden Ratios for Espresso are:

              * Basket - 2:1

              * Cup - 7:1
